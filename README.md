# Pricing Houses - Washington
The main goal of this project is to predict the price value of different houses located mainly in the city of Seattle, however, some of them are in the rest of the state of Washington.

This project was developed by the following steps:
1. EDA (Exploratory Data Analysis): Starting as a priority step of the project, I designed a deep analysis on the data to observe patterns, correlation between the feature, null analysis, and distribution of the features (normal, lognormal, etc).
2. Preprocessing Features: After doing the Data Analysis under the main data, I added and transformed some features that would affect our predictive model.
3. Predictive Models Proposals: After the analysis and preprocessing of the features, the next step is to develope different models to compare them and decide the winning model, there were 4 kind of models in different versions each of them. Following that scenario, I decided the winning model after the evaluation results.
4. Conclusions.
